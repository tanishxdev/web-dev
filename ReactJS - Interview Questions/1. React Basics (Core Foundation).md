# 1. What is React and why is it used?

## Concepts

React is a **JavaScript library** created by **Facebook** for building **fast, interactive, and component-based user interfaces**.

Core ideas:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   UI is split into small reusable components → easier to maintain and scale.

2. **Declarative UI**
   You describe **what** the UI should look like, React handles the DOM updates.

3. **Virtual DOM**
   React updates only the parts of the UI that change, making it fast and efficient.

4. **One-Way Data Flow**
   Data flows from parent → child, making applications predictable and easier to debug.

5. **Reusable + Composable**
   Components can be combined to build complex UIs.

**Why it is used:**

* To build **high-performance** web apps
* To build **large, scalable applications**
* To handle **complex UI states** easily
* To create **single-page applications (SPA)**
* To write UI using **JSX**, which is close to HTML but powerful like JS

## Code (with comments)

```javascript
// Simple React functional component
// Purpose: Show how React builds UI using components

function Welcome() {
  // JSX returned by the component
  return (
    <h1>Hello from React Component</h1>
  );
}

// Rendering component to the DOM using ReactDOM
// React automatically updates only changed parts (Virtual DOM)
ReactDOM.render(<Welcome />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Explanation of code:**

* `Welcome` → A reusable component
* `return (...)` → UI written using JSX
* `ReactDOM.render` → Tells React to display the component on the page
* React efficiently updates UI using Virtual DOM internally

## Interview-Ready Short Answer

React is a **JavaScript library** for building fast and interactive UIs using a **component-based**, **declarative** approach. It uses a **Virtual DOM** to update UI efficiently and supports **one-way data flow**, making large applications easier to build, maintain, and scale. It's mainly used for building **single-page applications** and complex front-end interfaces.
