# JavaScript Mini Projects

A structured set of **30 HTML + CSS + JavaScript projects** designed to build and strengthen real-world frontend development skills.
This collection focuses heavily on **JavaScript logic**, **DOM manipulation**, **UI components**, **events**, **state management**, and **core web APIs**—the exact concepts tested in **machine coding rounds** and **frontend interviews**.

Each project is kept small, realistic, and extendable.
Every project starts simple (v1) and can grow into deeper versions (v2–v6) so you learn how real features evolve in production.

# Project Philosophy

This repository follows three rules:

1. **Learn by building, not copying**
   Each project includes clear logic, architecture reasoning, and step-by-step implementation.

2. **Focus on JavaScript fundamentals**
   DOM, events, async logic, fetch API, rendering, validation, localStorage, timers, and more.

3. **Real interview readiness**
   Each project corresponds to a type of problem commonly asked in machine coding rounds.
