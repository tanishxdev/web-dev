## 1. Daily Progress (Your Core Habit)

### Example 1

Day 74 // DSA + Dev

Linked List insertions & deletions today.
Not complex, but very easy to mess up if traversal isn’t clear.

Slow progress. Real progress.

---

### Example 2

Day 75 // DSA

Revisited BFS vs DFS again.
Same topic, new clarity.

Repetition is underrated.

---

### Example 3

Day 76 // Web Dev

Next.js routing practice.
No UI, no data, just understanding how files map to routes.

Foundations first.

---

### Example 4

Day 77 // DSA + Dev

Graphs in the morning.
Backend bugs in the evening.

Balanced chaos.

---

## 2. Lesson Learned (High-Signal Posts)

### Example 1

Linked lists taught me this:
Most bugs don’t come from logic.
They come from moving the wrong pointer.

---

### Example 2

Binary Search isn’t about mid.
It’s about deciding which half is impossible.

---

### Example 3

I realized today:
If you can’t explain a concept simply,
you probably don’t understand it deeply yet.

---

### Example 4

Graphs feel hard until traversal clicks.
After that, most problems look like variations.

---

## 3. Struggle → Clarity (Relatable Growth)

### Example 1

I can solve JavaScript interview questions.
Explaining them out loud still feels difficult.

Learning that explanation is a separate skill.

---

### Example 2

Spent 30 minutes debugging.
Bug was one wrong pointer.

Painful lesson.
Memorable one.

---

### Example 3

Today reminded me:
Confidence comes *after* repetition,
not before it.

---

### Example 4

Some days I feel behind.
Then I remember I’m on Day 70+
and still showing up.

---

## 4. Micro-Teaching (Small, Valuable Posts)

### Example 1

Why `"2" + "2"` → `"22"`
but `"2" - "2"` → `0`?

Because `+` works with strings.
`-` forces numeric conversion.

---

### Example 2

Why we never traverse a linked list using `head` directly?
Because once you move it, you lose the list.

Always use a temp pointer.

---

### Example 3

BFS uses a queue.
DFS uses a stack (or recursion).

Same graph.
Different thinking.

---

### Example 4

Topological sort only works on DAGs.
If there’s a cycle, ordering is impossible.

---

## 5. Question / Reflection (Engagement + Learning)

### Example 1

How did you get better at explaining concepts in interviews?
Practice? Teaching? Mock interviews?

---

### Example 2

Do you prefer learning DSA in depth first
or revisiting the same topics multiple times?

---

### Example 3

At what point did graphs start feeling “manageable” for you?

---

### Example 4

Do you write notes while learning
or rely more on repetition and coding?

---

## How to Use This (Simple Plan)

* Post **1 daily progress** (always)
* Add **1 lesson OR struggle OR micro-teaching** every 2–3 days
* Ask **1 question per week**
